# FOODY_App

This project aims to create a user-friendly app that provides a comprehensive collection of Middle Eastern recipes, including images, ingredient lists, total calorie counts, and more.

## Must Have Feature

- Responsive Design: My application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- Data Fetching via API: We leverage an API to dynamically fetch the latest recipe information, ensuring that our users always have access to up-to-date content.

- In the landing page (Home Page):

  - It will has 3 main sections ( Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) each section will contains an img of the most famous recipes and information about the tradition of each daily meal.
  - If the user click on one of the daily meals section, he will get many recipes cards.

  - Users will have the ability to search for recipes using a search bar.

  Recipes Details Page:

  Whenever a user selects a recipe from the list, this page will display additional details about the selected recipe.

## Nice to Have Feature
